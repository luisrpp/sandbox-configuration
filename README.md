# Sandbox-configuration

Sandbox-configuration is an extention to the [Sandbox](https://getsandbox.com) platform that allows you to control the timeouts and failures of your routes.

The timeout configuration will only work with a customized version of Sandbox, available [here](https://github.com/luisrpp/sandbox).

## Getting Started

Just start [Sandbox](https://getsandbox.com) setting the base dir to the root of this repository.

## Route configuration

The route configuration can be defined on your code (there is an example in the source code), or at runtime via the url [http://localhost:8080/configuration](http://localhost:8080/configuration):
