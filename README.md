# Sandbox-configuration

Sandbox-configuration is an extention to the [Sandbox](https://getsandbox.com) platform that allows you to control the timeouts and failures of your routes.

The timeout configuration will only work with a customized version of Sandbox, available [here](https://github.com/luisrpp/sandbox).
